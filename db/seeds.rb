It is not known exactly when the text acquired its current standard form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar who was the publications director at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, discovered the source of the passage sometime before 1982 while searching for citings of the Latin word 'consectetur', rarely used in classical literature.[1][3] The physical source of the Lorem Ipsum text may be the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the De Finibus, where the Latin text finishes page 34 with 'Neque porro quisquam est qui do-' and begins page 36 with 'lorem ipsum (et seq.)â€¦', suggesting that the galley type of that page was scrambled to make the dummy text seen today. This suggests that 'lorem ipsum' may have been used as dummy text before the Letraset transfer sheets popularized it.")
